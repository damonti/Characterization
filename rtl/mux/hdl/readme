here we have different TBs for different inputs (2, 3... 8). such templates are used by tb_gen.py script to generate the various testbenches for various input parameters that you will find into /rtl/mux/characterization. It could be improved by having only one template; here in this directory you will find one template for each "factor" of the mux, since i did not automatized this part.
