The script automatizes the testbench generation, synthesis, netlist simulation and power estimation of a payload for a parametrized mux (factor, data_activity, bit_width).

TODO:
- come up with a power model from the database generated
- demonstrate it for other RTL rather than mux (i.e. router)
